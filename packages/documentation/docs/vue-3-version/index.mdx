:::warning
Be aware that if you use this method, you cannot use TitleCase for your components and your attributes.
That is, instead of writing `<GmvMap>`, you need to write `<gmv-map>`.
:::

## Global styles

The plugin exports a simple `css` file to add minimum styles to the main `GmvMap` component.

````ts title="main.ts" showLineNumbers {3}
import { createGmapVuePlugin } from '@gmap-vue/v3';
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import '@gmap-vue/v3/dist/style.css';
import App from './App.vue';
import './style.css';

const app = createApp(App);
app.use(createGmapVuePlugin({
  load: { key: '...' },
}));
app.mount('#app');
````

## Dynamic Library Import

We follow the recommendation of the Google Maps team, who encourages to tuse the dynamic load of the library. For more information please follow this [link](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/load-maps-js-api#dynamic-library-import).

## Migrating from version for Vue 2

- You can import the package from `'@gmap-vue/v3'` instead of `'gmap-vue'`
- The install fucntion of the plugin now is not exported by default, it is exported by name as we show below

````ts
import { createGmapVuePlugin } from '@gmap-vue/v3';
````

- All components now are lazy loaded, that means if you don't use it in your code they are not include in your final bundle. This change makes the `installComponents` property unuseful.
- The config proerty `installComponents` was removed.
- The `$gmapDefaultResizeBus` global property was removed.
- The `customCallback` option is deprecated
- We add a new global property `$gmapOptions` it contains the final options object received by the plugin.
- All components now are prefixed with `Gmv`, eg: `GmvMap` in the case of the Map component.
- The `initGoogleMapsApi` now is called `googleMapsApiInitializer`
- The `MapElementFactory` now is called `pluginComponentBuilder`
- The `GoogleMapsApi` now is only a global variable attached to the `window` object
- All mixins were removed, now they are composable functions
- Many of the old factories and helpers now are internal composable functions and they are not exposed by the plugin because, is not intended to be used.
- The `createGoogleMapsAPIInitializer` now is called `googleMapsAPIInitializerFactory`, and it is an internal function of the plugin.
- The `mapped-props` concept was removed from the plugin and now every component has its props defined on it.

:::note
If some of the changes are missed here please open a PR to add it to this list, thank you.
