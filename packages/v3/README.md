## Migrating from version for Vue 2

In the new version of this plugin for Vue v3 we introduce many changes on the structure and also we tried to improve some names to be more intuitive. Please for more detail refer to our [documentation](https://diegoazh.github.io/gmap-vue/docs/vue-3-version/#migrating-from-version-for-vue-2).

## CONTRIBUTORS ARE WELCOME

If you have time to contribute to a rather frequently used library, feel free to make a PR!, but first please read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/diegoazh/gmap-vue/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

What's urgently needed are:

1. Better unit tests (we use Vitest).
2. Better integration tests (we use Cypress)
